        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h4>
            An undergraduate student from De La Salle University-Dasmari√±as taking up a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I believe
            that as long as we continue to climb, we should never measure the valley of the mountain we conquered and reached, even how small it was.

            <h3 id="listening"> Listening to music </h3>
            <p id="listen">I used music as a form of solitude when I was still a teenager. Isolating myself from toxic feelings with the help of music has become my prescription whenever I feel like I need to get rid of anxiousness.</p>

            <h3 id="playing">Playing Table Tennis</h3>
            <p id="play">Table tennis is one of my favorite sports, which I like playing whenever I can. I enjoy using a paddle to hit a ball and giving it a shot to smash it in order to work on my flexibility.</p>
